# Digital Payment Platform

## Project Overview
The **Digital Payment Platform** is a robust console-based application built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, primarily focusing on **Encapsulation**. This project efficiently manages multiple users and their transactions while ensuring data security and structured class design. 

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure **SignUp** and **Login** functionality.
- **Payment Transactions**: Users can **send money** and check their account balance.
- **Account Management**: Retrieve payment-related credentials securely.
- **Multi-User Handling**: Supports multiple users simultaneously.
- **Transaction History**: Users can check credited and debited amounts.
- **Exception Handling**: Proper handling of errors to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Scalable OOP Design**: Classes and objects are structured for maintainability and scalability.

## Project Flow
1. **Sign Up**: Users register with their credentials.
2. **Login**: Users authenticate themselves to access their accounts.
3. **Transaction Processing**:
   - A user sends money to another user.
   - The recipient can log in and verify the credited amount.
4. **Secure Logout**: Ensures user session security.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (OOP-based development)
- **Exception Handling** for error management
- **File Handling** (if applicable, to store user credentials and transactions)

## OOP Principles Applied
- **Encapsulation**: Secure data access using getters and setters.
- **Classes & Objects**: Well-structured and modular design for efficient coding.
- **Exception Handling**: Proper management of runtime errors for seamless transactions.

## How to Setup and Configuration
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/STARJAN-J/Digital-Payment-Platform-Application.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd digital-payment-platform
   ```
3. Compile and run the project:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Adding more robust error handling.
- Implementing advanced transaction features.
- Improving code efficiency and modularity.
